after that we have to copy the url of the repository then come back to git bash and then 
enter 
git clone along with the url
 it will clone the data from the repository
 after that go to that repository by using cd repo/
 after we can see the files which we have in our repository
 afte that what we have to do is 
 touch file
  git add file /git add .(after giving this comman it will goes from working directory to staging area)
  after that we have to commit it by using the command
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git push origin main
